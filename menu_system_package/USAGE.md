# RHCI Instructor VT Toolkit - Standalone Executable

## Quick Start

### Running the Menu System
```bash
# On macOS/Linux:
./menu_system

# On Windows:
menu_system.exe
```

### First Time Setup
1. Make sure `config.yml` is in the same directory as the executable
2. Run the executable from a terminal/command prompt
3. Navigate using arrow keys, Enter to select, Esc to go back

## Features
- Multi-level menu system based on config.yml
- Interactive shell interface (ðŸ’» Command Shell)
- Command execution with output display
- Built-in help system (F1 key)

## Configuration
Edit `config.yml` to customize your menu structure:
- Add new menu categories
- Define shell commands to execute
- Add help text for menu items

## Shell Interface
The built-in shell runs within the TUI:
- Type commands like `ls`, `pwd`, `date`
- Use `cd` to change directories
- Type `exit` to return to main menu
- Note: Tab completion is not available (TUI limitation)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Permission denied**: Make sure executable has run permissions
